# Introduction 

<p>To prevent transmission of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus among exposed health care workers (HCW), the WHO recommends the use of tight-fitting facepiece respirators such as the FFP2 or N95.1  However, global personal protective equipment (PPE) stockpiles are shrinking rapidly because of the elevated demand during the COVID-19 pandemic and since the capacity to expand PPE production is limited while supply chains are disrupted and counterfeit deliveries discovered, severe local shortages of trustworthy respirators are a reality.2-4  Possible deconfinement measures are likely to increase demand even further as indications to wear respirators become broader (i.e. semi-urgent surgery for affected COVID-19 patients)<sup>[<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341666605_Verification_of_two_Alternative_Do-it-yourself_Equipment_Respirators_Seal_as_COVID-19_Protection_VADERS-CoV_a_quality_assessment_pilot_study">source</a>]</sup>. 
  
  We aimed at mitigating the shortage of respirators with do-it-yourself Respirator (ADR) with components found in most hospitals - using a CPAP inline filter (using the appropriate filter - N-95, HEPA etc).
